# Firebase Realtime Database: Safely Accessing Nested Properties

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase Realtime Database and provides a solution for safely accessing nested properties within asynchronous operations.  The problem arises when trying to access nested properties that may not always be present in the database snapshot, leading to runtime errors or unexpected `undefined` values.

## Problem

Directly accessing nested properties in a Firebase snapshot without proper error handling can cause issues if those properties are missing. This is particularly common in asynchronous operations where data structure isn't guaranteed.

## Solution

The solution involves using optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators to safely access nested properties.  This ensures that the code handles cases where properties are missing gracefully, preventing unexpected errors.

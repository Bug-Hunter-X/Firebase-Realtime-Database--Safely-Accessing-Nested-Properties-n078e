The following code snippet demonstrates a common error when using Firebase's Realtime Database. The issue lies in how data is structured and accessed, specifically when dealing with nested objects and asynchronous operations.

```javascript
// Incorrect approach: Assuming data structure and directly accessing nested properties
firebase.database().ref('users/' + userId).once('value', function(snapshot) {
  const userName = snapshot.val().name; // Error prone if 'name' is missing
  const userAddress = snapshot.val().address.street; // Error prone if 'address' or 'street' is missing
  console.log('User Name:', userName);
  console.log('User Address:', userAddress);
});
```

The problem with this is that it doesn't handle cases where the `name` or `address.street` property might be missing in the database snapshot. This often leads to unexpected `undefined` values or runtime errors.
